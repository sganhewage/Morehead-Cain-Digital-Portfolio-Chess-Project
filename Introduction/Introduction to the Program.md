# Morehead Cain Digital Portfolio: Chess Program

This is a chess program that I completed at the beginning of my junior year for my Scientific Computing Course. 
This Github link contains the actual game--which runs on Python--as well as a video of a quick walkthrough of the program.

To move a piece, you must first click on the piece you want to move, and then click the location that you want to move it to.
If the location you click is not a possible move, nothing will happen, and you will have to repeat the process outlined above.

This program should follow the rules of a normal chess game, and will display a message when there is a check or checkmate.

The program also displays the team that is supposed to move a piece. Additionally, the program includes a move counter and a list
that updates with the different pieces that have been captured for each team.
